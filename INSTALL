	Five steps to configure, compile and install icmp dataengine

1. Before you start, make sure you have all the necessary to compile Kde
programs for your system. On Ubuntu family (and probably Debian) you need the
following packages:
	- build-essential
	- cmake
	- kdelibs5-dev

2. Open the file CmakeLists.txt with a text editor and find the settings for
PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR and SERVICES_INSTALL_DIR. Probably they are at the top of
the file. Check if the pointed directories exist and actually contain file
ending in .so (the first) and in .desktop (the latter).

3. Run this command (without the dollar sign)
	$ cmake CmakeLists && make

4. Become root and type:
	# make install
or if you're an enabled sudoer:
	$ sudo make install

5. Leave root privileges and restart plasma desktop this way:
	$ kquitapp plasma-desktop; sleep 1; plasma-desktop 2>/dev/null


Then install “Kool morning” and configure the applet.
