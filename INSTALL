	Five steps to configure, compile and install icmp dataengine

1. Before you start, make sure you have all the necessary to compile Kde
programs for your system. On Ubuntu family (and probably Debian) you need the
following packages:
	- build-essential
	- cmake
	- kdelibs5-dev

2. Make the dir 'build' and cd to it
	$ mkdir build && cd build

3. Run this command (without the dollar sign)
	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .. && make

4. Become root and type:
	# make install
or if you're an enabled sudoer:
	$ sudo make install

5. Leave root privileges and restart plasma desktop this way:
	$ kbuildsycoca5 && kquitapp5 plasmashell && kstart5 plasmashell

-----

Alternatively run the install.sh script in the current directory

-----

Then install “Kool morning” and configure the applet.
